They contain up to four different ores.\n\n\u00a7dSurface rocks\u00a7r indicate the type of veins that are below them. In \u00a72JEI\u00a7r, press U on the Tiny Dust you mined from the rock and navigate to the \u00a7aOre Page\u00a7r. This page contains details on what types of ores generate, their generation patterns, their spawning dimension and Y-level range, and their spawning weight, which is the chance it spawns.\n\nOre veins generate in a \u00a74Grid\u00a7r. Every vein is spaced by 3 chunks from one to another in a cardinal direction.\nThey spawn at the \u00a74Center\u00a7r of the Chunks which have both their X and Z coordinates be at \u00a7b1 plus a multiple of 3\u00a7r (-8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, ...).\n\nIt will be simpler if you simply rely on \u00a72In Game Info\u00a7r displayed in the top left corner. In most cases there will be a \u00a7dSurface Rock\u00a7r in the Center of the Chunk, which provides completely accurate information for the Ore Vein.\n\nHowever Ore veins may be deleted by caves, Oil deposits, or from trying to generate above the ground.\n\nIt's a good practice to make \u00a7dWaypoints\u00a7r to every vein you find, and to label their type. You may want to come back to it several times.\n\nThis modpack also includes the mod \u00a7dVisualOres\u00a7r, which will mark discovered veins on your map. \u00a79Right Click\u00a7r an ore block in the vein to add it to the map. You can toggle the ore vein view in the lower left corner of the fullscreen map.\n\n\nEach Ore vein is always \u00a7d7 blocks\u00a7r tall, and ores generate in 4 different patterns:\n- The \u00a79Top Ore\u00a7r generates in the higher 4 layers of the vein.\n- The \u00a79Bottom Ore\u00a7r generates in the lower 3 layers of the vein.\n- The \u00a79Between Ore\u00a7r generates in the middle 3 layers of the vein.\n- The \u00a79Sporadic Ore\u00a7r generates anywhere in the vein. There will be the least amount of this ore in a vein.\nThe same ore type can be in 2 different generation patterns, such as in Cassiterite veins.\n\u00a7\n\n\nIn \u00a76LV\u00a7r Age, you can craft an Ore Prospector to assist yourself in finding ores.",

That is \u00a7dfour different veins\u00a7r that virtually have Iron Ore.\n\nDo not bother about ore processing yet. \u00a7aDirect smelting will be the most efficient for a while\u00a7r, given how easy it is to obtain a lot of ores.\n\n\nGather \u00a7eany\u00a7r of the Iron yielding Ores to complete this quest.",

I shall present you the solution: the Crafting Station.\u00a7r\n\nThe \u00a73Crafting Station\u00a7r is a highly \u00a79advanced Crafting Table\u00a7r, with inventory slots for item and tools. Put the recipes either by dropping ghost items, or using the \u00a7a+\u00a7r in \u00a72JEI\u00a7r. Crafting the items will use the items and tools in the inventory. The 9 slots on the right are saved up recipes so you can re-use them without re-opening \u00a72JEI\u00a7r.\n\nWhat makes the \u00a73Crafting Station\u00a7r amazing, is the fact that \u00a76it can use adjacent inventories\u00a7r in addition to its own inventory. If you are familiar to playing with Applied Energistics, the Crafting Station is essentially a mini ME Crafting Terminal.\n\n\n\u00a7bLore:\u00a7r The reason Nomifactory had Forestry in its modlist was primarily due to its Worktable, which serves a similar function to the Crafting Station. A couple more Forestry items were used, otherwise the whole mod's functionality was disabled!",

This small guide is an \u00a7dintroduction to Ore Processing\u00a7r.\nThe main purpose of GregTech Ore Processing is to provide \u00a7abyproducts\u00a7r on top of the initial outcome. At Steam Age, none of the byproducts are obtainable.\n\n\u00a79The steps available in Steam Age go as follows:\u00a7r\nOne Ore (block) \u00a79->\u00a7r Two Crushed Ores (Macerator)\nOne Crushed Ore \u00a79->\u00a7r One Impure Dust (Hammer)\nOne Impure Dust \u00a79->\u00a7r One Dust (\u00a7oIn world crafting explained below\u00a7r)\nOne Dust \u00a79->\u00a7r One Ingot (Furnace, you should know this one)\n\nA pickaxe or mining hammer enchanted with Hammering, or a GregTech Hammer directly gives Crushed Ores from breaking Ore blocks, but only at a 1:1 ratio. The Fortune enchantment can increase this ratio, to 2x with Fortune III, which matches the Macerator.\n\nThe rule bends for ores giving more than two dusts (such as redstone), and for dusts that cannot be smelted (redstone again!). Yet you can still do direct smelting to get half the amount you would from the full processing.\n\n\u00a7dJEI does not indicate Impure Dust to Clean Dust conversion\u00a7r, so keep that in mind that you should \u00a7athrow them into filled cauldrons\u00a7r (full stacks at once to use less water).\n\nOre Processing will be explained further once you get into LV Age.\n\n\nThere, take this nice reward for your efforts learning this beautiful mess.",

There are no partial Amps, and Energy is transferred only if the full Amp \u00a7apacket\u00a7r can be received.\nIn summary, Energy is transported in \u00a7apackets\u00a7r of \u00a7132EU\u00a7r for \u00a77LV\u00a7r, \u00a71128EU\u00a7r for \u00a7bMV\u00a7r... Energy that is actually received can be lower with cable loss.\n\nMachine Energy Input is limited by \u00a72Voltage\u00a7r (too high and boom!), and by \u00a7dAmperage\u00a7r. Thus, a \u00a7bMV\u00a7r Machine with \u00a7d2A\u00a7r Input connected to a \u00a77LV\u00a7r line will never accept more than \u00a7964EU/t\u00a7r.\nIt is still possible to run \u00a7bMV\u00a7r Machines on \u00a77LV\u00a7r lines, but only if the recipes are low enough \u00a79Power\u00a7r, or if you have a \u00a73MV Battery\u00a7r in the charging slot. The machine will only accept \u00a7d1A\u00a7r when idle, and so the \u00a73Battery\u00a7r will recharge only at \u00a7932EU/t\u00a7r.",

Maintenance in GregTech is not as bad as you think, and looking at multiblocks with this hatch makes me feel happy.\u00a7r\n\nMost Multiblocks require a \u00a73Maintenance Hatch\u00a7r. You will need to do Maintenance for the Multiblock to begin operating.\nThis is done by having a \u00a79Wrench\u00a7r, a \u00a79Screwdriver\u00a7r, a \u00a79Soft Mallet\u00a7r, a \u00a79Hammer\u00a7r, a \u00a79Wire Cutter\u00a7r, and a \u00a79Crowbar\u00a7r in your inventory, opening the Maintenance Hatch and \u00a7eclicking the center spot once\u00a7r. \u00a7cNo need to move tools individually\u00a7r.\nAlternatively you can fix problems by placing a \u00a79Tape\u00a7r in the Maintenance Hatch, but I would love to tell you that's unethical.\n\nMaintenance problems have a \u00a7d5%\u00a7r chance of occuring every \u00a7dhour of activity\u00a7r. Needless to say they are very rare. Each problem increases the recipe durations by 10%. Fixing the problems is done the same way as above.\n\n\nAt \u00a76HV\u00a7r age, you will unlock other Maintenance Hatches that do not enforce fixing the problems manually.\n\n\n\u00a7bLore:\u00a7r Maintenance dates back to GregTech 3 for Minecraft 1.5.2. That's a long time ago!\nMaintenance problems increased power usage instead of duration. And that caused all sorts of \"happy\" issues. Ah, fun times!",

Use your mouse to \u00a7drotate\u00a7r the preview, \u00a79hover over the parts\u00a7r to gain additional informations. The JEI page also contains the amount of blocks to build it. You can also \u00a7dright-click\u00a7r a block in the preview to get a display of all available blocks in that placement.\n\n\n\u00a7lThe JEI preview is a suggestion:\u00a7r There is no unique way to form the Multiblock. Most of the time, you have complete freedom for the \u00a79tier of Buses/Hatches\u00a7r. And you also have the \u00a7dfreedom of placement\u00a7r.\n\nTaking the EBF as example, any tier of Energy/Bus/Hatch can be used, and they can be placed anywhere replacing a casing. Fluid Hatches are also optional, though you probably want them to handle recipes with fluid.\n\nAdditionally, you can \u00a7dsneak right-click\u00a7r the multiblock controller for an \u00a76in-world preview\u00a7r, or use the \u00a74Terminal\u00a7r's Multiblock Helper.",

It is used in many important reactions, so you should automate its production soon.\n\nTo automate it, you will need \u00a73three LV Chemical Reactors\u00a7r. I would recommend building an isolated node somewhere with \u00a73one LV Generator\u00a7r to power all three machines. And then spaghetti the pipes for input and output (... or simply use AE2).\n\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Step 1: React \u00a7aSulfur\u00a7r with \u00a7bOxygen\u00a7r, to form \u00a7aSulfur Dioxide\u00a7r.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Step 2: React \u00a7aSulfur Dioxide\u00a7r with more \u00a7bOxygen\u00a7r, to form \u00a7aSulfur Trioxide\u00a7r.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Step 3: React \u00a7aSulfur Trioxide\u00a7r with \u00a7bWater\u00a7r, to form \u00a7eSulfuric Acid\u00a7r.\n\nWhy am I not presenting these steps in the retrieval tasks...? So you don't have to make sure to submit every single one of them, that would be way too tedious if every quest were like that!\n\n\n\u00a7bLore:\u00a7r GregTech 5's Chemical Reactor only had one Fluid slot. To circumvent that, they would do cell chemistry. Now the way you would automate Sulfuric Acid was by having one cell travel from machine to machine and then looping back.

This is typically between \u00a7d150L\u00a7r to \u00a7d300L per second\u00a7r.\n\nWhen drained, fluid veins will slowly deplete. This will cause the fluid yield to decrease over time, until it reaches its depletion yield. At that point you should move the Rig to somewhere else.\nA \u00a73Basic Fluid Drilling Rig\u00a7r will last for 100,000 operations (with 1 second per operation) until depletion. This is enough for \u00a76well over 10,000\u00a7r buckets of Oil. Higher tier Rigs will massively increase the yield, while also decreasing the depletion rate.\n\n\nWhat you can find in the \u00a72Overworld\u00a7r:\n\u00a79Oil:\u00a7r richer in \u00a7aLight Fuel\u00a7r, the most appreciated variant.\n\u00a79Light Oil:\u00a7r richer in \u00a7aRefinery Gas\u00a7r, usable for power.\n\u00a79Heavy Oil:\u00a7r richer in \u00a7aHeavy Fuel\u00a7r, which has uses that are more niche.\n\u00a79Raw Oil:\u00a7r richer in \u00a7aNaphtha\u00a7r, the best source of the early-game oil products.\n\u00a79Natural Gas:\u00a7r grants \u00a7aRefinery Gas\u00a7r with no distillation required.\n\u00a7l\u00a79Salt Water:\u00a7r grants \u00a7aSodium\u00a7r and \u00a7aChlorine\u00a7r, useful later.\n\n\u00a7rWhat you can find in the \u00a7cNether\u00a7r:\n\u00a79Natural Gas:\u00a7r grants \u00a7aRefinery Gas\u00a7r but with higher yield than the Overworld vein.\n\u00a79Lava:\u00a7r you know what this is.\n\n\nFor starters you may have to tap randomly until you find something you like.

Fluid Outputs can only be placed starting on the second vertical layer, and only allow one per layer as well.\n\nThe \u00a73DT\u00a7r can form at any height from \u00a7c\u00a7c3\u00a7r to \u00a7c13\u00a7r blocks, allowing 2 to 12 Fluid Outputs.

Going forward, most new \u00a7acircuit-related recipes\u00a7r, as well as some unique things like \u00a73Fusion Casings\u00a7r, will need to be run in machines inside a Cleanroom.\n\nCreating it will put a test to your \u00a7aPolyethylene\u00a7r automation for all the \u00a7dPlascrete\u00a7r and/or \u00a7dCleanroom Glass\u00a7r you will make.\n\n\n\u00a72\u00a7lThe Structure:\u00a7r\n\nBe sure to check the \u00a79tooltip\u00a7r (a lot of information in there!).\nThe Controller always has to be in the center. The rest of the top layer has to be \u00a7dFilter Casings\u00a7r.\nAll edges have to be \u00a7dPlascrete\u00a7r, and the sides can be \u00a7dCleanroom Glass\u00a7r.\nPlacing \u00a73Generators\u00a7r or \u00a73Mufflers\u00a7r inside is \u00a7cnot allowed\u00a7r. The Cleanroom will unform.\nDo not forget the \u00a73Maintenance Hatch\u00a7r.\nIf the structure refuses to form, rotate or replace the Controller, it can be a bit finicky.\nWe will start off with a 5x5x5 Cleanroom, but you should upgrade its size when you start feeling cramped inside. It does not have to be a cube.\n\n\u00a72\u00a7lGetting things in and out:\u00a7r\n\nTransfer EU using \u00a73Hulls\u00a7r or \u00a73Diodes\u00a7r.\nItem and Fluid transfer can be done using \u00a73Passthrough Hatches\u00a7r.\n\u00a73Machine Hulls\u00a7r count as \u00a76ME Cables\u00a7r to extend your ME Network inside your Cleanroom.\nThe \u00a7dDoor(s)\u00a7r can remain open (not very realistic, but convenient).\n\n\u00a72\u00a7lThe Mechanics:\u00a7r\n\nThe Cleanroom starts \u00a74contaminated\u00a7r. While contamined, machines will not be able to operate.\nThe Cleanroom will drain 30EU/t and slowly increase the cleanliness.\nOnce \u00a79Clean\u00a7r, recipes can run. At that point it will only draw 4EU/t. Keep it powered at all times or it will get dirty again!\nThe bigger the Cleanroom, the longer it takes to become Clean.\n\n\u00a79Note\u00a7r: When the time comes, Multiblocks must also be put into Cleanrooms in order to run cleanroom recipes! \u00a75\n\n\u00a79\u00a7eConfigs:\u00a7r If you dislike the Cleanroom mechanics, it can be toggled off in the config file with \u00a75\"B:enableCleanroom\"\u00a7r. Multiblocks can be made to ignore cleanroom requirements with \u00a75\"B:cleanMultiblocks\"\u00a7r. We encourage you to try it out before deciding.\n\u00a7\n\n\u00a7bLore:\u00a7r The Cleanroom comes from GregTech 5. But as with many features, it is more punishing in that version. The recipes would simply run, but had a % chance of completion equal to the cleanliness of the Cleanroom. This caused a lot of accidental voiding! Furthermore, if the Cleanroom had a maintenance issue, the cleanliness would cap out at 90%, which means voiding 10% of items!\nGTCEu Cleanroom will \u00a76never void\u00a7r recipe outputs.",

But what are the advantages of using higher tier coils?\n\nThe latter three are quite straightforward. Higher tier coils reduce the \u00a7eprocessing time\u00a7r of the Pyrolyse Oven, reduce the \u00a79energy usage\u00a7r of the Cracking Unit, and increase the \u00a7anumber of parallel smelts\u00a7r and reduce the \u00a79energy usage\u00a7r of the Multi Smelter.\n\nFor the EBF, things get slightly more complicated. The EBF smelts items at a certain \u00a7dtemperature\u00a7r. This is mainly determined by the tier of heating coil used - \u00a76\u00a7r\u00a76Cupronickel\u00a7r is \u00a7d1800K\u00a7r, \u00a7bKanthal\u00a7r is \u00a7e\u00a7d2700K\u00a7r, etc. Additionally, starting from \u00a76HV\u00a7r, each tier of energy adds \u00a7d100K\u00a7r to the temperature.\n\nEach EBF recipe has a certain base temperature, for example, \u00a7bAluminium\u00a7r is smelted at \u00a7d1700K\u00a7r. If the EBF temperature is not high enough, the recipe can't be done. If the EBF temperature is high enough, 2 different bonuses are applied:\n\u00a79-\u00a7r For every \u00a7d900K\u00a7r above the recipe temperature, the amount of energy required is multiplied by \u00a7a0.95x\u00a7r, which stacks.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r For every \u00a7d1800K\u00a7r above the recipe temperature, one additional overclock will be \u00a76100% efficient\u00a7r; in other words, it will \u00a75quadruple the speed\u00a7r, instead of doubling it.",

Place the Drum above your Generator and right-click it with a \u00a75Screwdriver\u00a7r to auto-output into the Generator. \u00a7oYou had forgotten about that feature didn't you?\u00a7r\n\n\n\u00a7cNote:\u00a7r Do not forget to \u00a7dchunkload\u00a7r all 9 chunks of the ore vein with FTB Utilities (open the map in the top left corner, claim the chunks with left-click, and enable force loading with shift-left-click).\n\n\n\u00a79Tip:\u00a7r You can either a \u00a73ME Chest\u00a7r or a \u00a732x2 Drawer\u00a7r as the output inventory to make transporting the ores back home a simple task.

Note that they are currently still being worked on.\n\n\u00a79Guide Editor\u00a7r is used to write Guides! Just as above. The GTCEu wiki has some small instructions for how to write them. If you are feeling like helping us with filling up guides, please go ahead and message us on our \u00a78Discord\u00a7r (link is in the Curseforge page) with the work you've put, or contribute to our \u00a77GitHub\u00a7r.\n\n\u00a79System Settings\u00a7r changes... settings (duh) related to the Terminal. You can \u00a7bset your own background picture\u00a7r, remove the double confirmation on exit, and more. Most of the keybinds apply to the \u00a75Home\u00a7r button. Double clicking by default exists any open Application.\n\n\u00a79Multiblock Helper\u00a7r is split into two functionalities.\nA couple devices are required to be mounted, which enable \u00a7bVR visualization\u00a7r of multiblock structures.\nThe upgrade unlocked at \u00a76HV\u00a7r allows you to \u00a76debug\u00a7r and \u00a76auto-build\u00a7r.\n\n\u00a79Battery Manager\u00a7r, assuming you have a Battery mounted, checks the Energy level and indicates energy usage of other Apps.\n\n\u00a79Hardware Manager\u00a7r is used to mount Hardwares, such as Battery, to enable other Apps.\n\n\u00a79App Store\u00a7r (not exactly a Store) adds Apps to your collection, and allows upgrades for some of them. Keep in mind Apps may still require specific mounted devices to function.\n\n\u00a79Pong\u00a7r, \u00a79Theseus' Escape\u00a7r, \u00a79Minesweeper\u00a7r are minigame Apps. Don't forget to play GregTech, too!\n\n\u00a79Ore Prospector\u00a7r works the same way as the portable \u00a7dProspector\u00a7r and can be upgraded several times.\n\n\u00a79Fluid Prospector\u00a7r works the same way as the portable \u00a7dProspector\u00a7r (but for fluids!) and can be upgraded several times.\n\n\u00a79Recipe Chart\u00a7r is a wonderful chart planner to build Recipe Chains and visualize them.\n\n\u00a79GT Console\u00a7r configures machines as if you were using regular tools, but without using them! This is similar to the remote access from the \u00a73Central Monitor\u00a7r.\n\n\u00a79World Prospector\u00a7r is a \u00a7dX-Ray VR\u00a7r for filtered blocks.\n\n\u00a79Virtual Tank Viewer\u00a7r is used in combination with \u00a73Ender Fluid Covers\u00a7r. It stores information about all your \u00a7dVirtual Tanks\u00a7r.\n\n\u00a79Cape Selector\u00a7r lets you become fancy! You can have your characters wear a fancy \u00a7dCape\u00a7r.\n\n\u00a79Teleporter\u00a7r is what it sounds like. It creates a portal frame to teleport from anywhere to anywhere. This is a lategame toy, though.",

When low enough, it defaults to yield defined in the json file.\n\n\u00a79Tip:\u00a7r When the fullness drops below 30% (rough estimation), you can consider moving to another vein for the sake of power to yield efficiency. Aiming for the \u00a73Advanced Fluid Drilling Rig\u00a7r in \u00a75EV\u00a7r will be a nice goal, as not only it boosts the output significantly, but it also reduces the drain rate.\n",

Don't read past the TL;DR if you are not interested.\u00a7r\n\n\u00a7bLore:\u00a7r The Amperage bug, exploit or feature (call it whatever you want!) from GTCE has been \u00a7lfixed\u00a7r in GTCEu. The Energy network now works as intended.\n\n\u00a76\u00a7lTL;DR:\u00a7r For safety, match the Amperage limit of your Cables with the max amount of Amps from Energy Producers.\n\n\nYou surely have realised by now the Energy system in \u00a72GregTech\u00a7r is \u00a7cnot as simple\u00a7r as the \u00a71RF\u00a7r you may be used to using in modded Minecraft!\n\u00a71EU\u00a7r mechanics have a depth to them and are not dissimilar to real electricity. It can also be \u00a74dangerous\u00a7r if mishandled. But it also gives a lot of \u00a76satisfaction\u00a7r, if harnessed well.\n\nThis Quest tackles the \u00a79Amperage\u00a7r mechanics. As for the \u00a7dVoltage\u00a7r mechanics, that will be explained once you reach \u00a7bMV\u00a7r.\n\nEach single-block Generator in GregTech is configured to produce \u00a791 Amp\u00a7r for its voltage tier. For \u00a77LV\u00a7r, that results in \u00a7232EU/t\u00a7r.\nIf a machine requires 16EU/t, one packet of 32EU is sent every other tick (assuming no cable loss).\n\nA Battery Buffer with \u00a794\u00a7r Batteries can produce up to \u00a794 Amps\u00a7r, for \u00a72128EU/t\u00a7r as \u00a77LV\u00a7r, which is important for the \u00a73Electric Blast Furnace\u00a7r, or to run multiple machines simultaneously.\nGeneric machines are configured to draw up to \u00a792 Amps\u00a7r when less than \u00a7950%\u00a7r full to account for cable loss, but otherwise draw \u00a791 Amp\u00a7r. Other machines have specific \u00a79Amps IN\u00a7r, described in the tooltip.\n\n\u00a7aCables\u00a7r have an \u00a79Amperage \u00a7climit\u00a7r. Attempting to transport more Amps than the limit will \u00a74burn\u00a7r them.\n\n\u00a79Amps\u00a7r are drawn \u00a7oonly\u00a7r through the \u00a7aCables\u00a7r connecting the Producers and Consumers directly, and \u00a7oonly\u00a7r if the Consumers are active.\nThis means you can safely step down your Cable Amperage in certain places, feel free to experiment!",

At this point it will need the EU to start again.\nShadow of Greg's \u00a73Fusion Reactor\u00a7r (which is now GTCEu's Fusion Reactor) has an added mechanic called \u00a74Heat\u00a7r.\nWhen the reactor runs, the \u00a79EU to start\u00a7r is converted to \u00a74Heat\u00a7r. That Heat is preserved until the Reactor goes idle, at which point it will slowly go down.\nNext time a recipe is found, it will use all possible Heat and deduct it from the \u00a79EU to start\u00a7r, allowing you to save Energy for short pauses.\n\nThe \u00a73Fusion Reactor I\u00a7r can only run recipes up to 160MEU required EU to start. The maximum voltage tier this reactor can run recipes at is \u00a7dLuV\u00a7r. It will also only overclock up to \u00a7dLuV\u00a7r at best, even if you upgrade to ZPM Hatches, no need to attempt it.",

Overclocking is not energy efficient, which is why it is generally better to go for low tier machines in passive setups. One could also argue they are cheaper.\n\u00a73Processing Arrays\u00a7r make up for the sheer amount of machines you are making. If you wish, you can still use higher tier machines, but the power draw will be bigger.\nIf you have \u00a72Gregicality Multiblocks\u00a7r, just use those instead.\n\n\u00a7d-\u00a7r Optional things? Yes. Obtaining most Byproducts or getting better yields are completely up to you.\n\u00a73Thermal Centrifuges\u00a7r are close to mandatory, as they unlock a \u00a76unique Byproduct\u00a7r from the maceration step.\n\n\u00a7d-\u00a7r What ores should I prioritise? There are crucial ores and Byproducts to not miss out.\nChalcopyrite, Chalcocite, Bornite, Tetrahedrite, Pentlandite and Sheldonite ores should all be turned into \u00a7dPurified Crushed\u00a7r and sent to the \u00a76Platinum Group Metal\u00a7r chain.\nPurified Crushed Galena and Sphalerite may be reserved for Indium, until you have the Naquadah chain.\n\u00a7aGallium\u00a7r, \u00a7aChrome\u00a7r, \u00a7aNiobium\u00a7r, \u00a7aRare Earths\u00a7r, \u00a7aGlowstone\u00a7r are \u00a76Byproducts\u00a7r you want to prioritise (\u00a7oif I am missing any, hit us up on Discord and I may add it!\u00a7r).\n\n\u00a7d-\u00a7r Storage Buses? As you may know, automating with AE2 is very powerful.\n\u00a73ME Storage Buses\u00a7r can route items effortlessly. They also have a huge whitelist or blacklist configuration. Put them on the \u00a73TungstenSteel Crates\u00a7r, to buffer the items... or use a dedicated AE2 network, you choose.\n\n\nMore things to note:\nThe \u00a7aSmart Filter\u00a7r\u00a7r can be used for Electrolyzable items (refer back to the \"200 IQ Quest\" with the Smart Filter), but you may prefer setting up filter \u00a7emanually\u00a7r for that.\nThe \u00a7aSmart Filter\u00a7r can also be used to be configured to filter \u00a7dsiftable Purified Crushed Ores\u00a7r.\nFor ores that you want to process but don't want the Byproducts as it would take too long in the machines, prioritize filtering them for quick washing.\nThe typically \"best\" path is: Macerator -> Ore Washing -> Thermal Centrifuge -> Macerator. If you deviate from it for various reasons, you will have to set filters \u00a7emanually\u00a7r.",

Especially the Item P2P and the GTEU P2P.\u00a7r\n\n\u00a79Note:\u00a7r There are great resources online to explain how P2P Tunnels work. The short description is that they allow transfer of things from 1 input to endless output. They are linked using a Memory Card.\nThis Quest acts as a tutorial on how to use the P2P Tunnels to your own benefit.\n\n\n\u00a72\u00a7lThe GTEU P2P Tunnel:\u00a7r\n\nTo turn a P2P Tunnel into a \u00a7aGTEU P2P Tunnel\u00a7r, right-click it in the world with a \u00a7dWire\u00a7r or \u00a7dCable\u00a7r.\n\nThis is ideal in lategame situations, to avoid spamming Cables or Transformers. You can also use them in conjunction with the AE2 Quantum Bridge to power your high tier Miners and Drills outside your base.\n\nThere is a \u00a745% Voltage Tax\u00a7r on the output side of the P2P, resulting in 5% energy loss.\n\n\n\u00a72\u00a7lThe Item P2P Tunnel:\u00a7r\n\nTo turn a P2P Tunnel into an \u00a7aItem P2P Tunnel\u00a7r, right-click it in the world with a \u00a7dvanilla Chest\u00a7r.\nItem P2P Tunnels are useful in a more abstract way so let's start with an example.\n\n\u00a7eExample:\u00a7r Making a \u00a79HV Machine Hull\u00a7r in the \u00a73Assembler\u00a7r also requires an \u00a73Extractor\u00a7r for the Fluid. That is two machines, hence two inventories.\nYou could passively fill the Assembler with Polyethylene, \u00a7lor\u00a7r you can also include it in your \u00a7dPattern\u00a7r, in the form of 2 Bars (Ingots).\n\nNow, you may think the next step is just to dump the items in a Buffer and route the items with Pipes, however this system will eventually \u00a74jam\u00a7r due to the incompability with AE2 Interface blocking mode! Trust me.\nPlace the input of the \u00a7aItem P2P\u00a7r on your \u00a73ME Interface\u00a7r, and one output on the \u00a73Extractor\u00a7r, one on the \u00a73Assembler\u00a7r.\nThen, use Filter covers where the outputs are connected. \u00a7dOre Dictionary Filters\u00a7r are better, since you can configure them to \u00a79ingot*\u00a7r. Have them on \u00a7ewhitelist\u00a7r for the \u00a73Extractor\u00a7r, and on \u00a7eblacklist\u00a7r for the \u00a73Assembler\u00a7r (no Assembler recipe ever requires Ingots, that's an intentional design decision in GregTech). \nDo not forget \u00a7dBlocking Mode\u00a7r on your Interface.\n\n\n\u00a7oYes, that's another reason why it is good to store polymers (Polyethylene, PTFE, PBI) as Bars!",

Most of the lag usually comes from things that are unoptimized.\n\nThings to \u00a7cavoid\u00a7r in general:\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Entities are pretty bad. Ground items or mob entities should be kept as low as possible at any given time. Thankfully this should not be an issue in this modpack.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Building everything packed together in a small space. Note that this does \u00a7onot\u00a7r affect TPS, but you will suffer FPS drops instead.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Huge walls of drawers, as iterating through every single one of them for insertion and extraction can be pretty taxing.\n\nThings to\u00a7c avoid\u00a7r with AE2:\n\u00a79-\u00a7r ME Import and Export Buses on large networks. Use ME Interfaces instead.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Crafting Cards to passively do large requests. Note that this is not as bad as it used to be, thanks to the optimizations from AE2 Unofficial.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Recursive insertion and/or extraction through sub-networks. If you use sub-networks, make them do very specific things rather than interacting with another AE2 network.\n\nThings to \u00a7cavoid\u00a7r with GregTech (GTCEu has received a lot of improvements over GTCE, but it is possible to destroy your TPS, as with any mod):\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Many EU Producers connected to many EU Consumers in the same line. Instead, use a Diode or Battery Buffer to separate your line of generators to your line of machines.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Large amounts of Fluid Pipes. They are \u00a7onot\u00a7r laggy individually, but they can add up if you have thousands of them.\n\u00a79-\u00a7r Big Item Pipe networks.

This is \u00a7csignificantly more difficult to automate\u00a7r, and it is \u00a7aoff by default\u00a7r. Enable it if you want more of a challenge!\n\n\u00a79How to automate Ordered Item Inputs:\u00a7r\n\nThere are many ways to automate Ordered Items: GT item pipes, redstone, other mods, you name it! This quest will give a specific recommendation using \u00a73AE2\u00a7r.\n\nHave your Interface containing the patterns face an \u00a73Item P2P\u00a7r. Set two output P2Ps: one into the first \u00a73Input Bus\u00a7r, and the other into \u00a73Item Pipes\u00a7r. Make your Item Pipes connect to all Input Buses including the first.\nDo not forget \u00a7dBlocking Mode\u00a7r, and you have got yourself an easy automation! This will also work flawlessly once we inevitably add ordered item inputs.\n\n\u00a79How to automate Ordered Fluid Inputs:\u00a7r\n\nThis one is... more difficult. Fluid Pipes behave very different compared to Item Pipes, so you \u00a74cannot\u00a7r use the same solution as above. You can automate the fluids in a few different ways: \u00a73crafting cells of fluids\u00a7r or AE2FCR with \u00a73Fluid Packet Decoders\u00a7r. The decoder route is much better, and involves outputting the fluids as fluid packets directly, then decoding them in the right location. This quest won't explain how to do this entirely due to it being off by default, so the full solution is left as an exercize to the reader.\n\n\u00a7eConfigs\u00a7r: If you find this mechanic unfun, it can be disabled with the config \u00a75\"B:orderedAssembly\"\u00a7r for Ordered Items and \u00a75\"B:orderedFluidAssembly\"\u00a7r for Ordered Fluids. We strongly encourage you to try Ordered Items out before disabling it right away.",

          "desc:8": "\u00a7oFeeling scientific?\u00a7r\n\nThis quest will explain a mechanic of the Assembly Line: \u00a7dResearch\u00a7r.\n\nRecipes in the assembly line will often require Research. This means you need to do a few extra things before the recipe will run. You'll notice there's a second tab in \u00a73JEI\u00a7r: \u00a7dThe Scanner\u00a7r. Recipes needing Research will also have the output show in the Scanner's page.\n\n\u00a79Scanning\u00a7r:\n\nScanning is the first step for research. Take the item shown in JEI and put it with a \u00a73Data Stick\u00a7r to scan it. This will \u00a74consume\u00a7r the item and put Data on the Data Stick. Pretty straightforward, right?\n\nYou will need at least an \u00a76HV Scanner\u00a7r to progress to \u00a7dLuV\u00a7r, an \u00a75EV Scanner\u00a7r for \u00a7aLuV Energy Hatches\u00a7r, and an \u00a71IV Scanner\u00a7r for \u00a7aFusion Reactors\u00a7r. You can make any one of them to complete this quest.\n\nSee the next quest for how to use these \u00a73Data Sticks\u00a7r.\n\n\u00a79Data Manipulation\u00a7r:\n\nEventually, you'll want multiple Assembly Lines, but you won't want to re-scan for every Research. This is why you can also use the \u00a73Scanner\u00a7r to \u00a7dCopy Data\u00a7r. Place the data stick you want to copy in one slot, and a blank one in the other. This will copy the contents of the first stick into the second!\n\n\u00a74Important\u00a7r: Using two different data sticks with data on them will cause one to \u00a74overwrite\u00a7r the other. Be careful!\n\n\u00a79Data Storage\u00a7r:\n\nLater on, recipes will require different \u00a7aData Storage Items\u00a7r for research, such as the \u00a73Data Orb\u00a7r. This process will remain the same, but will use different Data Storage Items instead. They can also be copied the same way, but you cannot copy between different types of storage items.\n\n\u00a7eConfigs\u00a7r: If you find this mechanic unfun, it can be disabled with the config \u00a75\"B:enableResearch\"\u00a7r. We strongly encourage you to try it out before disabling it right away, since it becomes very significant late game content as you progress further into research.\n\n\u00a7bLore\u00a7r: In GT5, Assembly Line recipes would be hidden in NEI until you completed research for them. After scanning the data stick, you could view the recipe's ingredients by printing a book with the Data Stick - a long and annoying process! It was then made to display in NEI once you acquire the item.\nTecTech later made a nice machine which acts as a recipe viewer for the Data Stick (this mod is so great...).",

It will allow you to perform research which requires \u00a7aData Orbs and Modules\u00a7r.\n\nWhen running the \u00a73Research Station\u00a7r, energy and \u00a79Computation\u00a7r is needed. The latter is provided through an \u00a79HPCA\u00a7r, which is explained in the next quest. It is recieved with a \u00a73Computation Data Reception Hatch\u00a7r. Note that only one Reception Hatch is allowed in a Research Station.\n\nThis multiblock needs computation \u00a7dsporadically\u00a7r, which means the recipe will not reverse progress if you don't supply enough. It will simply halt in-place. It will also not progress at all without meeting at least the minimum computation rate. The machine will still draw energy constantly, even when recieving no computation however.\n\nTo scan items, the process is relatively similar. In the \u00a73Object Holder\u00a7r, place the target item in the center slot, and the data storage item in the other slot. Then provide computation, and the data storage item will be updated upon completion. When running, the target item will be Locked and cannot be removed.\n\n\u00a7eNote\u00a7r: To form this multiblock the \u00a73Object Holder\u00a7r must face the controller.",

There are \u00a7a9 slots available\u00a7r for different components, and there are some example layouts in the JEI previews.\n\nThere are two main types of components:\n- \u00a79Computation Components\u00a7r: These generate a certain amount of CWU/t and require EU/t and cooling.\n- \u00a79Cooling Components\u00a7r: These provide a certain amount of cooling, and require EU/t.\n\nCurrently Available Components:\n- \u00a79Empty\u00a7r: Fills a slot but otherwise does nothing.\n-\u00a79 Heat Sink\u00a7r: Requires no power but provides 1 cooling.\n- \u00a79Active Cooler\u00a7r: Requires power, PCB Coolant, but provides 2 cooling.\n- \u00a79Computation\u00a7r: Creates 4 CWU/t, but requires a lot of power and cooling.\n\nThe HPCA draws some power to idle. Power and cooling requirements are scaled between this idle upkeep power, and a maximum value depending on how much computation is being actively used.\n\nIf the HPCA is not given enough cooling, Computation components can be \u00a74damaged\u00a7r if it is running above \u00a7c100C\u00a7r. The idle temperature is \u00a7a20C\u00a7r. Only computation components can be damaged, and all other blocks will be unharmed.\n\nThe HPCA can only have 1 \u00a73Computation Data Transmission Hatch\u00a7r. You can connect it to the Reception Hatch of the \u00a79Research Station\u00a7r with Optical Fiber Cable to transmit the computation.\n\nBasic CWU/t Requirements for ZPM Tier:\n- \u00a7a4 CWU/t\u00a7r for \u00a7cZPM\u00a7r Sensors, Emitters, and Field Generators\n- \u00a7a8 CWU/t\u00a7r for \u00a7cZPM\u00a7r Enegy Hatches\n- \u00a7a16 CWU/t\u00a7r for \u00a73UV\u00a7r Circuits and beyond.\n\nDon't feel forced to go for 16 CWU/t immediately. There's lots to do in between these milestones.\n\n\u00a7bLore\u00a7r: This mechanic is loosely inspired by TecTech's Quantum Computer, which is similar but has some much more annoying mechanics like the Uncertainty Resolver.",

Add regular \u00a79Capacity Cards\u00a7r to increase the slots. Opening any \u00a79Pattern Terminal\u00a7r with the tool in your inventory or in a bauble slot will utilize Blank Patterns from these slots. You can also view this pattern storage GUI from any Pattern Terminal.\n\n\u00a72Bulk Pattern Modification:\u00a7r\nInserting \u00a79Encoded Patterns\u00a7r instead of blank ones will allow you to multiply/divide/add/subtract them all at once in bulk. Division and subtraction is enabled while holding \u00a7ashift\u00a7r. This GUI also shows up in the \u00a79Interface Terminal\u00a7r or any \u00a79ME Item/Fluid/Dual Interface\u00a7r\u00a7r. This is particularly useful when multiplying up your patterns for parallel on-demand machinery.\n\nPatterns can also be cleared in bulk with the \"Clear\" button. There is a confirmation after clicking it, but use with caution.\n\n\u00a72Item Search and Replace:\u00a7r\nR-clicking the tool and opening the \u00a7aReplace tab\u00a7r will bring up a new GUI. This GUI will allow you to replace all occurances of one item with another for the \u00a79Encoded Patterns\u00a7r stored within the tool. Successful replacements are highlighted in \u00a7agreen\u00a7r, and invalid patterns in \u00a7cred\u00a7r. This is particularly useful for \u00a7eupgrading GT circuits\u00a7r, such as transitioning from Nano to Quantum EV circuits.\n\n\u00a72Easy Pattern Transfer:\u00a7r\nShift-LClicking patterns will move them between the player inventory and the multitool where possible. This means you can easily move patterns around between interfaces and terminals without clogging your inventory.\n\n\u00a72In-Place Editing:\u00a7r\nRclicking an \u00a79ME Item/Fluid/Dual Interface\u00a7r will display the interface's patterns in the multitool. This will allow you to easily modify the patterns inside it without having to manually move them back and forth.\n\n\u00a7bLore\u00a7r: Neeve, the author of the NAE2 mod suggested tiering this item at \u00a7eUXV\u00a7r tier, because it \"gives the player way too much power.\" For reference, \u00a7eUXV\u00a7r is 4 tiers past \u00a73UV\u00a7r tier, two tiers before \u00a7c\u00a7lMAX\u00a7r voltage.",
